# hello-world

My name is Essa! 

I am actively seeking for a Security/Software Engineer internship for Fall and Spring 2021. Currently, I am a Security Engineer Intern at Verizon and an undergraduate student studying Cybersecurity at Illinois State University. I was a former Software Developer Intern at State Farm on Infrastructure and Security teams. I have skills in multiple computer programming languages, analyzing and modeling data, and utilizing tools and techniques to manage cyber security risks. Additionally, I am an advocate for initiating STEM within the community. This profile will contain my past and current projects.
