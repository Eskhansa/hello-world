Hello world.

My name is Essa Khan. As of now, I am a junior in High School and I am planning on majoring in Computer Science when I go to college. 
I had taken a computer programing with problem solving class last year and I am taking an Advanced Placement Computer Science class this
year! In the computer programing with problem solving class I learned how to use the language C#. In the Advanced Placement Computer
Science class I am learning the language of Java.
